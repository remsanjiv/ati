  abstract  = "Machine learning (ML) is changing virtually every aspect of our
               lives. Today ML algorithms accomplish tasks that until recently
               only expert humans could perform. As it relates to finance, this
               is the most exciting time to adopt a disruptive technology that
               will transform how everyone invests for generations. Readers
               will learn how to structure Big data in a way that is amenable
               to ML algorithms; how to conduct research with ML algorithms on
               that data; how to use supercomputing methods; how to backtest
               your discoveries while avoiding false positives. The book
               addresses real-life problems faced by practitioners on a daily
               basis, and explains scientifically sound solutions using math,
               supported by code and examples. Readers become active users who
               can test the proposed solutions in their particular setting.
               Written by a recognized expert and portfolio manager, this book
               will equip investment professionals with the groundbreaking
               tools needed to succeed in modern finance.",

@ARTICLE{Raymer2007,
  title    = "Spontaneous knotting of an agitated string",
  author   = "Raymer, Dorian M and Smith, Douglas E",
  abstract = "It is well known that a jostled string tends to become knotted;
              yet the factors governing the ``spontaneous'' formation of
              various knots are unclear. We performed experiments in which a
              string was tumbled inside a box and found that complex knots
              often form within seconds. We used mathematical knot theory to
              analyze the knots. Above a critical string length, the
              probability P of knotting at first increased sharply with length
              but then saturated below 100\%. This behavior differs from that
              of mathematical self-avoiding random walks, where P has been
              proven to approach 100\%. Finite agitation time and jamming of
              the string due to its stiffness result in lower probability, but
              P approaches 100\% with long, flexible strings. We analyzed the
              knots by calculating their Jones polynomials via computer
              analysis of digital photos of the string. Remarkably, almost all
              were identified as prime knots: 120 different types, having
              minimum crossing numbers up to 11, were observed in 3,415 trials.
              All prime knots with up to seven crossings were observed. The
              relative probability of forming a knot decreased exponentially
              with minimum crossing number and M{\"o}bius energy, mathematical
              measures of knot complexity. Based on the observation that long,
              stiff strings tend to form a coiled structure when confined, we
              propose a simple model to describe the knot formation based on
              random ``braid moves'' of the string end. Our model can
              qualitatively account for the observed distribution of knots and
              dependence on agitation time and string length.",

  abstract    = "Suppose that asset pricing factors are just p-hacked noise.
                 How much p-hacking is required to produce the 300 factors
                 documented by academics? I show that, if 10,000 academics
                 generate 1 factor every minute, it takes 15 million years of
                 p-hacking. This absurd conclusion comes from applying the
                 p-hacking theory to published data. To fit the fat right tail
                 of published t-stats, the p-hacking theory requires that the
                 probability of publishing t-stats < 6.0 is infinitesimal. Thus
                 it takes a ridiculous amount of p-hacking to publish a single
                 t-stat. These results show that p-hacking alone cannot explain
                 the factor zoo.",

  abstract = "Several papers argue that financial economics faces a replication
              crisis because the majority of studies cannot be replicated or
              are the result of multiple testing of too many factors. We
              develop and estimate a Bayesian model of factor replication,
              which leads to different conclusions. The majority of asset
              pricing factors: (1) can be replicated, (2) can be clustered into
              13 themes, the majority of which are significant parts of the
              tangency portfolio, (3) work out-of-sample in a new large data
              set covering 93 countries, and (4) have evidence that is
