## Total word count should be 1500 words excluding references
## When you knitr the document the references should automatically populate at the end of the document
```

## Instructions to use this template

1. Update the author and title fields in the above YAML section.
2. Edit the `refs.bib` file to include any extra references you have. 
3. Click `Knit` to see what the output will look like
4 . Save the .Rmd file using the naming convention specified in class

## Introduction


This should be introduce the statement to be critiqued in the context of modern financial research practices.

## Critical literature

Use high-quality literature to illustrate the pros and cons of the argument. 

Some examples of how to use the `.bib` to add references
* In line `@Jensen2021` renders as Jensen (2021)
* And `[@Jensen]` renders as (Jensen 2021)

## Experimental evidence

Simulate some data to illustrate how FML can reveal results where traditional econometrics fail OR vice versa.  You are free to use the lecture material as a starting point here.  For example

```{r}
# package which will do much of the heavy lifting
set.seed(1234) # set seed for random number generation
size=1000
df<-tibble(x=rnorm(size),y=0*x+rnorm(size))
bXY=numBins(nrow(df), corr=cor(df)[1,2])
y2D=discretize2d(df$x,df$y,numBins1 = bXY,numBins2 = bXY)
Hx=entropy(rowSums(y2D))
Hy=entropy(colSums(y2D))
nmi=mi.empirical(y2D)/min(Hx,Hy)
cor(df)[1,2]->cor_coef
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
# use ggplot2 hist2d geom to extract
ggplot(df,aes(x=x,y=y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "y= 0x + e") + 
  annotate("text",label=paste0("nmi=",round(nmi,4)),x=-2.5,y=3) +
  annotate("text",label=paste0("cor_coef=",round(cor_coef,4)),x=-2.5,y=2.5)
```

## Your conclusions

Summarise and state your critical assessment using any evidence you have provided in the previous sections.

## Reference

*This is where the citied references should appear when you render the document to a pdf*
